# Machine Learning
Machine Learning course

In this course, we will learn about machine learning and its concepts with their implementation using Python, Numpy, Pandas and many more.


 - What is Machine Learning? <br>
 It is the science of getting computers to learn without explicitly being programmed. <br>
 It is new branch of Artificial Intelligence <br>
 New capability of computers

- Definitions of Machine learning: <br>
There is no single definition for machine learning. Few are below.

 Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.

 Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

**Examples**
- Database Mining : Large data sets from growth of automation/web
- Applications cannot program by hand : Autonomous Helicopter, Handwriting Recognition, NLP, Computer Vision
- Self customising Programs : Amazon, Netflix recommendations
- Understanding Human learning (Brain, real AI)

### Various types of Machine Learning Algorithms

- Supervised learning :  We teach computers to how to do something
- Unsupervised learning : The Computer will learn by itself how to do something
- Others : Reinforcement learning, recommender systems

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
  **Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.**
